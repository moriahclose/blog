To my mother-in-law,

If I met you before marrying Chris, I would have told you that I never wanted to be married. I didn't want a family. I didn't want a husband, or kids, or anything in between. I wanted to be in a large home by myself that I left and entered as I pleased. 

When I met your son, I didn't think anything of it. He was cute, but I figured nothing would come of it. When we started dating, I thought nothing would come of that.

Then something changed I wouldn't say I feel in love, but I realized that every part of me and Chris' relationship was the work of God.

I knew that as long as I was with your son, I would never forget God's love, grace, mercy and care for me. That's how I knew I should marry him.

The first time I imagined having a mother-in-law was when Chris and I were engaged. I was relieved that I wouldn't have to meet you beforehand. I imagined the traditional mother-in-law and fianc√© meeting where you drill me with questions about your son and why I love him and how I plan to be a good wife. I would stumble over my words because I hadn't thought about it before.

Now that I am married to your son, I wish we had that meeting. I wish I knew you more. There's so much about Chris that I don't understand and I wonder if you do. There's so much I want to know about his past and I wonder if you could tell me. If I were a stronger woman, I'd reach out, but I'm scared. I'm not sure if I'm afraid of what you'd say or afraid of how Chris would respond, but I am afraid.

Maybe, if things were different and I were braver, we'd talk a lot. I'd know what state you're in and what your last name is.

I learned by surprise that you'll be in Michigan when Chris and I visit this Spring. I'm excited to meet you, but I'm still scared. 

It's my own fault. I'm paralyzed by the fear on both sides.


Anyways, see you next week.

Your daughter-in-law,

Moriah
