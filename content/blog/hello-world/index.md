I recently saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZmxAOHyDBI) by The Futur where Chris Do interviews Seth Godin.

I should probably know more about Seth Godin, and I will, but I don't yet.

Seth says you should write a blog every day.

I think that's a good idea, because I also watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujxvy5NjeRQ) by The Futur. Chris Do says to learn something, you have to share it.

I agree, so that's what I'll do with this blog. I'll consume some information, then write about just to make sure I'm thinking. I hope you learn something here too.
